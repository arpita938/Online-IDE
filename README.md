# Online-IDE
I have build an Online-IDE using HTML,CSS,JavaScript,API and jQuery for UI side development and design.In the server side, I have used PHP, just to keep things as simple as possible.<br>It supports <b>C,C++,Java,Python,& JavaScript.</b>This is further extensible to any other language as well.
